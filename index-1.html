<h1 id="singlepage-website-for-the-lazy-dog">Single–Page Website for the Lazy Dog</h1>
<p>This is a cheat sheet for people who want to create a single–page website the quick–and–dirty way.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Its main purpose is to show that decent websites are possible with a minimum of resources and a bit of common sense only.
I am not going to say that you will be able to accomplish each and every web development task with what data this repository
contains. Quite to the contrary, rely on your creativity and don’t be afraid to think “outside the box”.
As far as the content of the “cheat sheet” goes, no voodoo or black magic was employed. The words are my own, but the knowledge,
and most of the code, may be found on the Internet in numerous ways and fashions.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-this-repository">How to Use this Repository</h2>
<p>Download the repository to your computer. It doesn’t matter whether you have a local webserver installed; it will work with
or without a server environment. After decompressing (unzipping) the downloaded file, you will have a directory (folder)
called “single–page”. Store the donwnloaded .zip file and/or the decompressed directory in a safe place.
Always work off a copy! Shit happens, and in such cases it’s always nice to have a clean copy ready.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-have-a-local-webserver-installed">If You Have a Local Webserver Installed</h3>
<p>If you do have a local webserver, move the directory called “single-page-master” to your server’s root directory.
To launch the cheat sheet, type http://localhost/single-page-master/cheatsheet.html in the address bar of your browser.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-dont-have-a-local-webserver-installed">If You Don’t Have a Local Webserver Installed</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a local webserver, enter the directory called “single-page” (wherever you stored it)
and open cheatsheet.html in your browser. The address bar will then read something like:
file:///path/to/location/of/single-page-master/cheatsheet.html</p>
<h2 id="take-your-time">Take Your Time</h2>
<p>Read through cheatsheet.html, everything is sufficiently explained and commented (or so I hope).
Don’t expect to complete your project inside of ten minutes or an hour (or what wonders you are commonly promised).
That’s not going to happen. Web design and development is not child’s play. After all, your finished website is
going to “live” out in the wilds of the Internet – a public area, in other words – and you will never know your next visitor.</p>
<h2 id="technical-information">Technical Information</h2>
<p>This repository also contains a local copy of a jquery file (js/jquery.min.js) so you can work offline, but still
have full functionality. The only difference you will experience is that your browser will return to default fonts.</p>
<h2 id="licences">Licences</h2>
<p>While my words (in cheatsheet.html) are released under the “WTFPL licence” (you may do with them whatever you effing please),
note that individual scripts and files the repository contains were released under different licences by their respective
creators. For details consult the “Resources” section of the cheat sheet.</p>
